# Snafu-Expansion-Mod-Market-Files
Files needed for Trader &amp; Market to sell SNAFU weapons in Expansion Market

These are priced via Grok using real world criteria plus a premium for the Post Apocalyptic scenario DayZ presents. Everything for the most part takes into account what other similar things cost.
The reasoning behind this is to avoid having a ridiculous server economy where things cost tens of thousands of dollars. I try to avoid the temptation to create "rarity" by pricing.
Having every SNAFU rifle cost 25,000 is absurd, lol. You can easily go into your types file and change value to Tier 4, so it only spawns in high risk areas. In some instances you may want to
remove the weapon from the market entirely and change the tpes Nominal value to 1 so only 1 pops on map. Or change the value to 0 so none ever spawn and you can offer one as a reward for a big event or equip a tough AI with one to loot. 
Or sell the weapon, but not the ammo, so players have to go to risky places to scrounge for ammo for their Barrett 50cal head exploder...

But, if your server economy is fucked & players are minting cash by mining gems or growing weed, feel free to change all the prices to 100,000 per rifle ;)
